### Coffee & Weed
This week, the Dev team is thrilled to spotlight one of the most active developers in the KaijuKingz community, CoffeeandWeed. One of the tools that mutant Kaijus have found particularly useful is https://twitter.com/erc1337_Coffee's mutant kaiju viewer https://mutantsniper.herokuapp.com/. This tool significantly enhances the quality of life for mutant kaiju holders by revealing additional information hidden behind the smart contracts, which function as the "brains" of our Kaijus.

In addition to developing tools for the community, CoffeeandWeed can also be found auditing smart contracts in search of vulnerabilities that put user funds at risk. He is an invaluable member of the community, and we appreciate his significant contributions.

### Neckbord
Neckbords has been a creative force within the community for quite some time, delighting members with animated Kaij, such as the remarkable transformation of Walt's Kaiju #2295 into the Ice King (featured above). Neckbords is an active participant in the Kaiju Art Discord community and has garnered attention for his captivating work on both his Instagram account and with Lil Oddities.
