### Fugashu

Finding top-notch development teams prepared to support your Web3 gaming endeavors can be challenging. This week, the KaijuDex team is excited to spotlight Fugashu and his company, Cojodi. Jonas, a seasoned expert in the field, and the KaijuDex team can’t wait for you to hear his story.

Hi, I'm Jonas, and four years ago, I ventured into the world of blockchain and web3 development. After several successful projects, I established my startup, Cojodi, in Germany [cojodi](https://cojodi.com). We primarily focus on creating websites, dApps, and DeFi applications for various companies and projects.

Currently, we're working on Play Valtreas (@play_valtreas), a 2D action RPG set to launch on Immutable later this year. Although we're in the early development phase, we have a robust plan and architecture. Our primary task now involves implementing all the planned features.

We're awaiting some final designs, but you can get a sneak peek at our progress by visiting our mini-site [valtreas](https://valtreas.com). At the moment, I'm developing the authentication and sign-up process, which you can check out at [valtreas-app](https://dev.app.valtreas.com).

Feel free to explore our hero editor mockup at https://dev.app.valtreas.com/play (click on the hero icon at the bottom). All items and equipment displayed there will be available in-game as NFTs. For example, when a player defeats a boss, our backend verifies the accomplishment and mints the NFT directly into the player's wallet. With Immutable, this process is gas-free, requiring players to link their web3 wallet to their account only once.

All items and equipment will be fully tradeable, providing a seamless gaming experience.

The KaijuDex team is delighted to feature @NewMythologi this week. Mythology commissioned artwork by @LipweiChangArt to narrate the story of several scientists in Sorashima City. Here's an insight into Mythologi’s creative thought process:

I was captivated by the idea of designing my Scientist. My inspiration comes from following a trail of excitement. I couldn't resist transforming my NFTs into stories and contributing to Sorashima's fan lore. Dots and the team did a fantastic job with the Scientist mint.

As a storyteller at heart, I announced on Twitter and Discord that we were forming a group, and people began joining the conversation. Each trait holds a hidden story, and it's thrilling to uncover these characters and their daily adventures in Sorashima. I aim to play a small part in bringing this vibrant city to life, one story at a time.
