### Bringing Pixel art to life with Midjourney in 4 steps
This week the KaijuDex team brings you a step-by-step guide on turning your PFP into a character you can use in future scenes, or twitter content.
We are going to take this `Augminted Scientist` and turn him into  a piece of art in the style of `Brian Kesinger.`

🚀 *Start with something real*

For this step we're going to use stock photo of a chimpanzee from  the Center of Great Apes.

🚀 *Next Generate your beta character*

*Prompt:* `<IMAGE> a brown chimpanzee-humanoid looking to the side, wearing a ping house robe and a pink visor, in the style of brian kesinger`

Not a bad start! even got something correctly placed in the mouth.

🚀 *Now we'll build the Scene*

*Prompt:* `a futuristic city, covered in smog, in the style of brian kesinger`

We didn’t provide any example art for the background as we wanted to let the AI gods decide.  We Were hoping for a little more NYC  smog, but this still came out cool.



🚀 *Putting it all together*


*Prompt:* ` <BETAIMAGE> <SCENEIMAGE> a chimpanzee-humaoid, wearing a pink house robe, wearing a pink visor, with a cigar in mouth, looking to the side, in a futuristic city covered in orange smog, in the style of brian kesinger`

Now you have an Augminted scientist in the style of Brian Kesinger ready to take on the world.  You can, of course, replace the art style with anything that resonates with you, but we thought this would be a fun starting point.


🚀  *Extra Tips*

🎁 Midjourney reads like as a datastream, NOT like a human. Meaning objects you want together should be placed together
take `a chimpanzee-humaoid` for example a`a chimpanzee humaoid` will give you a chimp, and a humanoid in the scene. So be careful!

🎁  You can reuse your `BETA` characters in your future scenes.

🎁  You can check out `Walt's` prompts for more insperation at the bottom of the article.

🚀 *Final Thoughts*

With a basic understanding of prompting and separating the creation of characters and scenes, generating engaging content becomes much easier to create. Remember to be specific with your prompting and provide a good base image for the AI as inspiration. The KaijuDex team hopes you enjoyed this tutorial, and we look forward to hearing your feedback!

`Thoughts on Binance and Coinbase`

Hoping this article finds you healthy and happy whenever you’re reading this. It’s certainly an interesting week in crypto.  With the SEC pressuring Binance and Coinbase, I have a little FUD, especially around my work in the industry. But hey, Crypto’s not for the faint of heart, and I remind myself that with these lawsuits, hopefully will finally get some clarity on regulation.
