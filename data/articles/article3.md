# Augmented Lab‚Äôs own BagelFace

### BagelFace

## Origin Story

I began my journey with NFTs and Solidity development in 2018 during a transition period between jobs. Together with a friend, we launched an NFT project in July 2018 named Star Cards. This project primarily consisted of curated IMDb data and an innovative on-chain auction system, similar to early Nouns-style auctions.

## Thoughts for Developers in the space

As this technology gains broader adoption, there will likely be counteracting forces. We must hold one another accountable and champion the essential aspects of this technology.

BagelFace‚Äôs  call to action is to consider joining a DAO. Some noteworthy examples include gnarDAO, Developer DAO, PizzaDAO, and Breadchain Co-op.

# Artist Kaiju King Spotlight: Kawpuccino

### Kawpuccino.eth

Honored and grateful to be nominated as the Artist of the Week in Sorashima:‚Äù) Appreciate the support Kingz, just thought I‚Äôd share a little bit about my story with the Kaijus! I started with zero knowledge of web3, joined several communities, and bought Mutant #3505.  In the middle of last year, I also told myself I needed a Genesis Kaiju. I worked my way by creating community traits like the NYC Kaiju and the Merlion Kaiju and did customs edits for the National Day celebrations for Kaiju Kingz SG. Without Dotss and the rest of the Kingz, I would not have gotten to where I am today. Lots of ups and downs in the process, but it has been an incredible journey reaching the Throne Room last Oct despite being a victim of a high-profile wallet drain.

Stay true to your style and voice as a creative! Don't be afraid to take risks and experiment with new things, but always remember to stay true to yourself and your vision. Never give up your goals, no matter how far-fetched they might seem. Take small steps and work your way up! Success may take time and effort, but anything is possible with dedication and hard work. Keep creating and pushing yourself; the Kingz community supports all endeavors, and you can always seek guidance from fellow builders. Do this, and you will see results in your learning journey. All the best, and Kingz on Top ü¶ñüëë
