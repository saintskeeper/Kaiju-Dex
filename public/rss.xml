<p><img src="/images/article2/kaijudex-mini-kaiju.png" alt="The Kaiju Renaissance " title="600, 600"></p>
<p>This week has been nothing short of action-packed for the Kaiju Kings! One of the most notable events is the community initiative focused on supporting artists. Twitter has been flooded with awe-inspiring community augments, as artists vie for the coveted opportunity to add their art to Augments Season three. Dots, the founder of Kaiju Kings, has also been at the forefront, championing fellow creators and extending support to other talented individuals within the community.</p>
<h1>Community Spotlights</h1>
<p>As the bull market approaches, the KaijuDex team remains dedicated to showcasing the finest talent in the space. This week, we are honored to feature three exceptional creators who are at the forefront, ushering in the illustrious Kaiju Golden Age.</p>
<h2>Developer 💻</h2>
<p>The KaijuDex team is honored to feature one of their esteemed members, Haruxe. A devoted security developer in the web3 space, Haruxe's expertise is truly valued by the team. In addition to his contributions in security, Haruxe also plays an integral role in shaping the direction of the KaijuDex user interface.</p>
<h3>Haruxe</h3>
<p><img src="/images/article2/Haruxe-profile.jpeg" alt="Haruxe" title="200, 200"></p>
<p>Greetings, Kingz! I'm Haruxe, a former game developer who transitioned to a web3 developer and security researcher. My days are filled with searching for vulnerabilities in smart contract code by performing audits and participating in bug bounties on Immunefi. I also develop and design traditional web applications, creating tools to simplify tasks for fellow developers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I write articles and publications to contribute to the security community and document my progress through various channels. Recently, I've been collaborating with BAO Finance on development and authoring articles with Immunefi. While I often find myself working on diverse projects, my passion always leads me back to security analysis and research.</p>

<p><strong>Mirror</strong>: <a href="https://mirror.xyz/haruxe.eth">haruxe.eth</a></p>
<h2>Creator 📺</h2>
<p>This week, our spotlight shines on insightful tips and tricks from one of our esteemed King of Kings, Qrs. As a thought leader in the crypto realm, Qrs consistently produces videos and engaging content for both the Sandbox and Kaiju King communities. Today, the KaijuDex team presents invaluable wisdom from Qrs, straight from Sorashima.</p>
<p><img src="/images/article2/Qrs-profile.jpeg" alt="Qrs" title="200, 200"></p>
<p>If there's a single nugget of wisdom I can share, it's the importance of stepping out of your comfort zone. This realization comes from witnessing students limit themselves and recognizing my own tendency to overthink instead of taking action. Embrace 'failure' as a learning opportunity and don't let discomfort prevent you from embarking on new ventures. The world is chaotic, and plans are bound to change. Adapt and embrace the chaos. By welcoming challenges and new experiences, you open the door to unexpected discoveries and innovations. Approach this mindset with curiosity and an open mind: ask questions, listen intently, challenge your assumptions, and consider diverse perspectives. This will help you cultivate a dynamic, thoughtful, and sustainable professional or creative practice.</p>
<p>In short: Pursue greatness. Don't hesitate.</p>

<h1>Augminted Labs Features the KaijuDex</h1>
<p>The KaijuDex team would like to thank Augminted Labs for featuring them in this week's Medium article release. If you haven't had a chance to read it, be sure to check it out. The link can be found in the footnotes of the article.</p>
<h1>Augminted Lab’s own BagelFace</h1>
<h3>BagelFace</h3>
<p><img src="/images/article3/bagelFace.png" alt="bagelFace" title="200, 200"></p>
<h2>Origin Story</h2>
<p>I began my journey with NFTs and Solidity development in 2018 during a transition period between jobs. Together with a friend, we launched an NFT project in July 2018 named Star Cards. This project primarily consisted of curated IMDb data and an innovative on-chain auction system, similar to early Nouns-style auctions.</p>
<h2>Thoughts for Developers in the space</h2>
<p>As this technology gains broader adoption, there will likely be counteracting forces. We must hold one another accountable and champion the essential aspects of this technology.</p>
<p>BagelFace’s  call to action is to consider joining a DAO. Some noteworthy examples include gnarDAO, Developer DAO, PizzaDAO, and Breadchain Co-op.</p>

<h1>Artist Kaiju King Spotlight: Kawpuccino</h1>
<h3>Kawpuccino.eth</h3>
<p><img src="/images/article3/kawpuccino.png" alt="kawpuccino" title="200, 200"></p>
<p>I started with zero knowledge of web3, joined several communities, and bought Mutant #3505.  In the middle of last year, I also told myself I needed a Genesis Kaiju.</p>
<p>I worked my way by creating community traits like the NYC Kaiju and the Merlion Kaiju and did customs edits for the National Day celebrations for Kaiju Kingz SG.</p>
<p>Without Dotss and the rest of the Kingz, I would not have gotten to where I am today. Lots of ups and downs in the process, but it has been an incredible journey reaching the Throne Room last October despite being a victim of a high-profile wallet drain.
<img src="/images/article3/seth-khaw-ezgif-com-resize.gif" alt="monster-hunter" title="800, 800">
Stay true to your style and voice as a creative!</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to take risks and experiment with new things, but always remember to stay true to yourself and your vision. Never give up your goals, no matter how far-fetched they might seem.</p>
<p>Take small steps and work your way up! Success may take time and effort, but anything is possible with dedication and hard work. Keep creating and pushing yourself; the Kingz community supports all endeavors, and you can always seek guidance from fellow builders. Do this, and you will see results in your learning journey.</p>
<p>All the best, and Kingz on Top 🦖👑</p>

<h1>WANTED</h1>
<p><img src="/images/article3/Wanted-Article-3.png" alt="monster-hunter" title="400, 400"></p>
<p>Kawpuccino, one of our esteemed Kaiju Kings and a leading artist in the web3 world, has suffered a devastating loss: their prized KaijuKing was stolen for a measly .16e. As a team of security experts, we understand the importance of respecting the hustle and the potential for black hat operations to occur.</p>
<p>Therefore, we at KaijuDex stand in solidarity with Kawpuccino and vow to do everything in our power to help retrieve their stolen artwork. If you know the current holder of Kawpuccino's KaijuKing, please don't hesitate to reach out to a member of our Dex team. We are willing to work with you and offer a 250% ROI to ensure that the artwork is rightfully returned to its rightful owner.</p>
<p>We believe in the importance of community support and the mutual respect that comes with it. Let's work together to ensure that Kawpuccino's artwork is returned safely and that we can all continue to thrive in the web3 world with integrity and respect for one another's creations. 🌟</p>

<h1>Celebrating creators in the space.</h1>
<h2>Developer of The Week</h2>
<h3>Fugashu</h3>
<p><img src="/images/article4/Fugashu.jpg" alt="Fugashu" title="200, 200"></p>
<p>Finding top-notch development teams prepared to support your Web3 gaming endeavors can be challenging. This week, the KaijuDex team is excited to spotlight Fugashu and his company, Cojodi. Jonas, a seasoned expert in the field, and the KaijuDex team can’t wait for you to hear his story.</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Jonas, and four years ago, I ventured into the world of blockchain and web3 development. After several successful projects, I established my startup, Cojodi, in Germany <a href="https://cojodi.com">cojodi</a>. We primarily focus on creating websites, dApps, and DeFi applications for various companies and projects.</p>
<p>Currently, we're working on Play Valtreas (@play_valtreas), a 2D action RPG set to launch on Immutable later this year. Although we're in the early development phase, we have a robust plan and architecture. Our primary task now involves implementing all the planned features.</p>
<p>We're awaiting some final designs, but you can get a sneak peek at our progress by visiting our mini-site <a href="https://valtreas.com">valtreas</a>. At the moment, I'm developing the authentication and sign-up process, which you can check out at <a href="https://dev.app.valtreas.com">valtreas-app</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to explore our hero editor mockup at <a href="https://dev.app.valtreas.com/play">play-valtreas</a> (click on the hero icon at the bottom). All items and equipment displayed there will be available in-game as NFTs. For example, when a player defeats a boss, our backend verifies the accomplishment and mints the NFT directly into the player's wallet. With Immutable, this process is gas-free, requiring players to link their web3 wallet to their account only once.</p>
<p>All items and equipment will be fully tradeable, providing a seamless gaming experience.</p>

<h3>NewMythology</h3>
<p><img src="/images/article4/newMythology.jpg" alt="NewMythology" title="200, 200"></p>
<p>The KaijuDex team is delighted to feature @NewMythology this week. Mythology commissioned artwork by @LipweiChangArt to narrate the story of several scientists in Sorashima City. Here's an insight into Mythology’s creative thought process:</p>
<p>I was captivated by the idea of designing my Scientist. My inspiration comes from following a trail of excitement. I couldn't resist transforming my NFTs into stories and contributing to Sorashima's fan lore. Dots and the team did a fantastic job with the Scientist mint.</p>
<p>As a storyteller at heart, I announced on Twitter and Discord that we were forming a group, and people began joining the conversation. Each trait holds a hidden story, and it's thrilling to uncover these characters and their daily adventures in Sorashima. I aim to play a small part in bringing this vibrant city to life, one story at a time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/article5/walt-_cute_girl_with_cat_ear_hoody_sitting_on_the_shoulder_of_b_5215a903-5169-40f7-9137-a12aa69f36cf.png" alt="walt-vibe-girl" title="600, 600"></p>
<h3>What you can expect</h3>
<p>In June, you can expect at least four articles from the KaijuDex. Content on the Dex is heading in a different direction however, with practically all content coming from the KaijuDex team, we will be focusing on content that we find essential, plus news and stories relating to tech. The extended explanation can be found in a thread by <code>Walt-</code> which will be linked at the end of the article.</p>
<h1>Cool Tech</h1>
<h3>Lockable Functions by Augminted Labs</h3>
<p>We came up with "lockable" functions, which allows for granular state immutability by adding function modifiers to "only owner" functions. It allows contract owners to prune off contract functionality they no longer need/want exposed as an attack vector. Collection owners usually NEED to maintain contract ownership to integrate or configure collections on third-party apps like OpenSea, but don't necessarily want contracts to be vulnerable if keys are compromised.</p>
<p>A perfect example of this was back in 2022 when a vulnerability was identified in the BAYC contract that would allow the contract owner to mint an arbitrary amount of new BAYC tokens. Of course, this created a wave of FUD calling upon Yuga to "burn" contract ownership, which they eventually did (an successfully spun it to ensure the immutability of the token metadata).</p>
<p><img src="/images/article5/Vaulted-functions.png" alt="vault" title="400, 400"></p>
<p>There was a few-month period of hesitance to perform the contract burn from the founders because contract ownership is pretty useful. One benefit of being the #1 NFT company is that you can be sure you'll be given special treatment if an issue arises or a dispute occurs. However, other smaller founders aren’t afforded this privilege and can't take the same leap that Yuga did by burning their contract ownership. If BAYC had lockable functions, they could have easily just "flipped a switch" and maintained contract ownership. Lockable functions are displayed on the Augminted Scientists contract and all the other KaijuKingz P2E contracts, linked at the bottom of the article.</p>
<h2>Scam of the week</h2>
<p>Sad that this needs an actual section now. Anonymity brings out the best and worst in people. This Week’s scam surfed on the backs of the pudgy penguins hype straight into the dumpster. Please stay safe out there and remember to trust your gut. This project started out fishy and is a great case study on a long con.</p>
<p><img src="/images/article5/Scam-Of-The-Week.jpeg" alt="scam" title="600, 600"></p>
<h2>Walt's Corner</h2>
<p><img src="/images/article5/walt-_computer_streaming_code_placed_on_top_of_a_rock_in_futuri_d7fdcb15-cad2-4f7a-9108-ac8cc1f72dbf.png" alt="walt" title="600, 800"></p>
<p>Each month here until the end of the year, I will be working on bringing another micro app to the open-source community.
This month’s focus is on Discord bots and integrations. As the KaijuDex continues to evolve, curating quality content and providing more value to the community is my primary focus. Thus the month of June will focus on creating features to integrate KaijuDex with the KaijuKingz Discord, and provide useful commands and utilities to the community.</p>
<h2>What you can expect this month</h2>
<p><code>1.</code> A command palette to be added to the <code>KaijuKing</code> Discord</p>
<p><code>2.</code>  Initial integration will be wit the KaijuKing NFTs, with the Api open-sourced for future NFT extensibility.</p>
<p>Be sure to follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Walt_eng">Twitter</a> to get weekly updates on the process.</p>
<h1>A sincere thank you</h1>
<p>When we started the KaijuDex, we never expected to receive the community support that we did. The KaijuDex team and I want to thank the community for sticking with us.</p>

<p>With everything going on in the crypto space  the Dex team wants to make sure the community  has quality tutorial for leveling up your generative art game to create more engaging Twitter content.This week the KaijuDex team is excited to present a tutorial on leveraging Midjourney to bring your PFP to life, Funny sections by <em>Hokin</em>, and <em>Walt’s</em> Corner.</p>
<h1>Cool Tech</h1>
<h3>Bringing Pixel art to life with Midjourney in 4 steps</h3>
<p>This week the KaijuDex team brings you a step-by-step guide on turning your PFP into a character you can use in future scenes, or twitter content.
We are going to take this <code>Augminted Scientist</code> and turn him into  a piece of art in the style of <code>Brian Kesinger.</code></p>
<p><img src="/images/article6/Midjourney-how-to/scientist.png" alt="stock-photo" title="400, 400"></p>
<p>🚀 <em>Start with something real</em></p>
<p>For this step we're going to use stock photo of a chimpanzee from  the Center of Great Apes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/article6/Midjourney-how-to/Stock-photo.jpg" alt="stock-photo" title="400, 400"></p>
<p>🚀 <em>Next Generate your beta character</em></p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> <code>&#x3C;IMAGE> a brown chimpanzee-humanoid looking to the side, wearing a ping house robe and a pink visor, in the style of brian kesinger</code></p>
<p>Not a bad start! even got something correctly placed in the mouth.</p>
<p><img src="/images/article6/Midjourney-how-to/beta-char.png" alt="stock-photo" title="400, 400"></p>
<p>🚀 <em>Now we'll build the Scene</em></p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> <code>a futuristic city, covered in smog, in the style of brian kesinger</code></p>
<p><img src="/images/article6/Midjourney-how-to/smog-background.png" alt="final-monkey" title="400, 400"></p>
<p>We didn’t provide any example art for the background as we wanted to let the AI gods decide.  We Were hoping for a little more NYC  smog, but this still came out cool.</p>
<p>🚀 <em>Putting it all together</em></p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> <code> &#x3C;BETAIMAGE> &#x3C;SCENEIMAGE> a chimpanzee-humaoid, wearing a pink house robe, wearing a pink visor, with a cigar in mouth, looking to the side, in a futuristic city covered in orange smog, in the style of brian kesinger</code></p>
<p><img src="/images/article6/Midjourney-how-to/final-chimp.jpeg" alt="background" title="600, 600"></p>
<p>Now you have an Augminted scientist in the style of Brian Kesinger ready to take on the world.  You can, of course, replace the art style with anything that resonates with you, but we thought this would be a fun starting point.</p>
<p>🚀  <em>Extra Tips</em></p>
<p>🎁 Midjourney reads like as a datastream, NOT like a human. Meaning objects you want together should be placed together
take <code>a chimpanzee-humaoid</code> for example a<code>a chimpanzee humaoid</code> will give you a chimp, and a humanoid in the scene. So be careful!</p>
<p>🎁  You can reuse your <code>BETA</code> characters in your future scenes.</p>
<p>🎁  You can check out <code>Walt's</code> prompts for more insperation at the bottom of the article.</p>
<p>🚀 <em>Final Thoughts</em></p>
<p>With a basic understanding of prompting and separating the creation of characters and scenes, generating engaging content becomes much easier to create. Remember to be specific with your prompting and provide a good base image for the AI as inspiration. The KaijuDex team hopes you enjoyed this tutorial, and we look forward to hearing your feedback!</p>
<h2>Walt's Corner</h2>
<p><code>Thoughts on Binance and Coinbase</code></p>
<p>Hoping this article finds you healthy and happy whenever you’re reading this. It’s certainly an interesting week in crypto.  With the SEC pressuring Binance and Coinbase, I have a little FUD, especially around my work in the industry. But hey, Crypto’s not for the faint of heart, and I remind myself that with these lawsuits, hopefully will finally get some clarity on regulation.</p>
<p>Gandhi: First they <code>ignore</code> you, then they <code>laugh</code> at you, then they <code>fight</code> you, then you <code>win</code></p>
<p><code>KaijuKingz Discord Bot</code></p>
<p>This week, Hade had a great discussion with Kittens and Arby on the requirements for the new Discord bot.</p>
<p><em>highlights from the call.</em></p>
<p>🚀 All current core functionality will be focused on within the next 45 days</p>
<p>🚀 Modular components allow for features to be quickly added and implemented for holders</p>
<p>🚀 Service Level agreements to provide a higher quality product for the community</p>
<p>Excited to have the opportunity to work on this for one of my all time favorite NFT communities. If you haven’t joined the KaijuKing ecosystem, what’s stopping you?</p>
